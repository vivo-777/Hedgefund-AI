## 📖 Overview

The **AI Equity Research Agent** is a sophisticated financial analysis tool designed to simulate the workflow of a human hedge fund analyst. Unlike simple chatbots, this application uses an **agentic workflow** to:

1.  **Gather Real-Time Data:** Fetches live prices, technical indicators, and financial news.
2.  **Reason & Analyze:** Uses Llama-3 (via Groq) to synthesize fundamental and technical data.
3.  **Critique & Refine:** A secondary "Risk Manager" agent reviews the initial draft for hallucinations or bias.
4.  **Visualize:** Generates interactive charts and a professional investment memo.

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Cyclic Graph Architectures (LangGraph)** and **Production-Grade Deployment (CI/CD)**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The core of this application is a **State Graph** managed by LangGraph. It operates in a loop rather than a linear chain:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B(Data Collector Agent)
    B --> C(Technical Analyst Agent)
    C --> D(Fundamental Analyst Agent)
    D --> E(Writer Agent - Draft Memo)
    E --> F{Risk Manager Review}
    F -- "Rejected (Needs Revision)" --> E
    F -- "Approved" --> G[Final Dashboard Output]


Analyst Node: Aggregates data from yfinance and Tavily Search.

Critique Node: Reviews the report for logical inconsistencies and "hallucinations."

Orchestrator: Manages the state and context window.

🚀 Key Features
⚡ Ultra-Fast Inference: Powered by Groq LPU running Llama-3-70b for sub-second report generation.

📊 Live Market Data: Real-time integration with Yahoo Finance for price, volume, and P/E ratios.

📰 Sentiment Analysis: Scrapes top financial news sources to gauge market sentiment using Tavily API.

📈 Technical Indicators: Automatically calculates RSI, MACD, and SMA signals.

🛠️ CI/CD Pipeline: Fully automated deployment to Render on every GitHub push.

🛠️ Tech Stack
LLM Engine: Groq API (Llama 3)

Orchestration: LangChain & LangGraph

Frontend: Streamlit

Visualization: Plotly

Data Sources: yfinance (Market Data), Tavily (Search/News)

Infrastructure: Render (PaaS)
